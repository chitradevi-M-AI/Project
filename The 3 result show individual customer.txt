The 3 result show individual customer-level predictions from your Telco Customer Churn XGBoost model.


1. Raw features of a specific customer
2. Predicted Churn Label (0 or 1)
3. Predicted Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
4. A SHAP waterfall plot showing why the model predicted that result
These outputs are correct and show your model is working.

Customer Raw Features
You see values like:

Payment Method
Monthly Charges
Total Charges
Paperless Billing
Tech Support
Streaming TV, Movies
Contract
etc.
These are encoded numeric values representing customer details.
Churn Label = 0
This means: The model predicts the customer will NOT churn
CLTV = 4812
CLTV = Customer Lifetime Value
Your model estimates this customer will bring Rupees  4,812 more revenue in the future (or whatever unit you're using).
Waterfall SHAP Plot
The blue and red bars represent:
Blue = factors that reduce churn probability
Red = factors that increase churn probability
Since the final result is 0 (no churn)- the blue side is stronger.
Customer #2 Raw Features
You see another customer’s encoded details.
Churn Label = 0
Again: This customer is also predicted NOT to churn
CLTV = 5157
This customer is estimated to generate higher future revenue compared to Customer #1.
SHAP Explanation
The model shows:
High monthly charges
Long contract
Online services
Paperless billing
These affect churn probability.
Blue bars dominate -so churn likelihood remains low.
Customer #3 Raw Features
Another customer's values displayed.
Churn Label = 0
Again: Model predicts NO churn
CLTV = 2894

This customer has a lower lifetime value compared to the other two.
SHAP Explanation
Blue values show:
Contract type
Tech support
Monthly charges
are reducing churn risk.
Hence the model outputs a low churn probability.
 Final Meaning of All 3 Results
Customer	Churn Label	CLTV	Meaning
#1	0	4812	Will stay, moderate value
#2	0	5157	Will stay, high value
#3	0	2894	Will stay, but low value
All 3 customers are predicted to NOT churn
